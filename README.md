## How to Submit Entry to Kaggle <a name="submitkaggle"></a>

1. **Train your model**. The training notebook must export its checkpoint (on a .ckpt (or) .pth file) to a '../input/EXPERIMENT_NAME' folder. This has to be done since on Kaggle, the checkpoint MUST be read from the '../input/EXPERIMENT_NAME' dir. Don't worry, the .gitignore assures that nothing in the input folder will be uploaded to the repo.
2. **Write an inference notebook**. It must read the checkpoint of the model, that must be on the '../input/EXPERIMENT_NAME/' folder, and iterate exactly through the '../input/birdclef-2024/test_soundscapes' folder, assuming there are files there and generate predicitions for them in chunks of 5 seconds in a './submission.csv' file. Each audio is 4min, then 48 chunks for file must exist. A good idea is to create an "if" statement that if the test_soundscapes is not empty, use it (for submitting), and if it is empty, take like, 10 samples from the unlabeled_soundscapes folder, so you can validate the predictions notebook BEFORE submitting to the challenge locally. **Any errors when submitting will count as a submission!!**
3. **Download the inference notebook and checkpoint**.
4. **Upload your checkpoint to Kaggle as a Kaggle dataset:** kaggle.com -> Datasets -> Browse Files -> Select .ckpt file ->  **Fill Dataset Title with EXPERIMENT_NAME** (This way, you'll be able to add it to the kaggle input folder later). 
5. **Upload your notebook to Kaggle:** kaggle.com -> Competitions -> BirdCLEF2024 -> Code -> New Notebook -> File -> Import Notebook -> Browser Files -> Select Your Notebook -> Import -> OK
6. **Add Your Kaggle Dataset with model checkpoint to input folder:** Input -> Add Input -> Search for your EXPERIMENT_NAME dataset -> Click on the + Symbol
7. **Run All. Important to check that it works BEFORE submitting.**
8. **Submit to Competition:** -> Submit -> Write a Comprehensible Version Name -> Submit!

## Repo Location on RECOD <a name="repolocation"></a>
Clone your repos on:
```
cd /work/RECOD.USER/AIMS-BirdCLEF
```

## How to Work on RECOD <a name="work"></a>
First build the image (already done on DL-08) (Assumes CUDA 11.0. If different, change base image, and torch versions to match.)
```
sh build_image.sh
```
Then, enter a container on GPU G, port PPPP, and with container name birdclef_container_N by running:
```
sh birdclef_container.sh -g G -p 'PPPP:PPPP' -n N
```
Work!

## How to pull, push or clone this repo on RECOD <a name="pull"></a>
This should all be done OUTSIDE containers.

First, copy the private repo key to your user folder and change its permissions.
```
cp /work/leonardo.boulitreau/birdclef /home/RECOD.USER/.ssh/     #  substituing RECOD.USER with you recod user
chmod 600 /home/RECOD.USER/.ssh/birdclef  #  substituing RECOD.USER with you recod user
```
Create a configuration File:
```
nano /home/RECOD.USER/.ssh/config #  substituing RECOD.USER with you recod user
```
Ctrl C on the following code, and paste on the editor
```
Host github.com
  HostName github.com
  User git
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/birdclef
```
Ctrl X then y then Enter to leave the editor and save.

Either pull 
```
cd /work/RECOD.USER/AIMS-BirdCLEF
git pull
```
or clone wherever you want
```
cd /work/RECOD.USER/
git clone git@github.com:leonardoboulitreau/AIMS-BirdCLEF.git    # Everytime it demands, on pull or push, the password is: tucano
git pull
```
or push
```
git add .
git commit -m 'commit message'
git push
```

## How to Download Data <a name="download"></a>


Entre no container, se√ß√£o [How to Work](#work). Depois, execute:

### Se estiver no RECOD
```
 cd /workspace/aimsbirdclef
 sh input/birdclef-2024/download_birdclef2024.sh /workspace/kaggle-token-leo/
```

### Se estiver no seu PC

Antes de tudo, tem que ter a token kaggle.json: Kaggle.com -> Settings -> API -> Create Token -> Download 

Al√©m disso, para baixar vers√µes anteriores voc√™ tem que aceitar as regras da competi√ß√£o: Kaggle.com -> Competitions -> BirdCLEFXXXX -> Late Submission -> Accept the Rules

```
 sh input/birdclef-XXXX/download_birdclefXXXX /path/to/the/FOLDER/in/which/kaggle.json/is/located/
```

O script j√° colocar√° tudo nos lugares corretos e remover√° o .zip ap√≥s extrair.
